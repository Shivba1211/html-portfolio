<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Shivam and I am 21 years old. For the past few years, I’ve been learning a Computer Science Cource. I have some background in Web Development, with a degree from Savitribai Phule Pune University. What really got me into this field is the curiosity for Websites. 
  Throughout my career, I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with numbers and handling data.
  I have excellent grades in my educational background.</p>

<p> I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
   In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work.
  For example, I taught myself how to work with the websites. I soon became the go-to person for any Website needs.</p>
